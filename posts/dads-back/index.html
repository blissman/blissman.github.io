<p>It turns out that our concern and indignation was unfounded, because today dad returned to the den! Dad&rsquo;s energy is a little more chill than mum&rsquo;s. While she&rsquo;s usually on high alert, dad&rsquo;s . . . having a sit on the hill looking over the field.</p>

<p>While he does so, the kits dig in to a nutritious breakfast (a disemboweled rabbit, courtesy of their papa).</p>
